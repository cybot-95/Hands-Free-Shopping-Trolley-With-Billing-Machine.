# Hands-Free-Shopping-Trolley-With-Billing-Machine.

The project's purpose is to make it easier for older people and pregnant women to use shopping carts at malls. It also cuts down on long lines at the billing desk during peak hours. 

The feature of our auto trolley is that it follows us by sensing the wrist band. The wrist band consists of the IR receiver which receives signals from IR transmitter placed in the trolley. This reduces the effort of pushing the trolley. We canâ€™t imagine the upcoming future in which technology may occupy each & everyfield. This innovative project idea can be used is places like shopping complexes, supermarkets & malls. Here RFID card is used to securely access every product in shopping places. If a product is scanned & put into the cart, all the required details of the product (such as name, quantity, price & expiry dates) will be displayed on the LCD screen. Therefore, an RFID tag/card is used for accessing the products.
